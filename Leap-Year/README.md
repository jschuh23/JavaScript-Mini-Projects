This course project was a challenge to determine which years are considered Leap Years. The project was an online exercise within the course with no written HTML or CSS.

### My Adjustments

1. Created desktop and mobile designs in figma
1. Wrote HTML code
1. Wrote CSS styles
1. Wrote JS code to be internal on the page and not as a prompt

### Lessons Learned

- I researched the use of inline SVG code within the HTML and how to make the code accessible. This included the following: 
    * Adding a `title` element as the first child of the `svg` element and giving the `title` an `id`
    * Adding an `aria-labelledby` attribute directly to the `svg` element and making it's value equal to the `id` given to the `title` element
    * Adding a `role` attribute with a value of `img` directly to the `svg` element
