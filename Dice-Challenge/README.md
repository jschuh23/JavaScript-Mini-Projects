This course project was a lesson based on creating a dice game. The project included basic HTML and CSS which were provided by the instructor, however I chose to create the HTML and CSS on my own to continue practicing this skill.

### My Adjustments

1. I created my own HTML file
2. I created my own CSS file
3. I created my own JS file

### Upcoming Changes

-   Enhance HTML file
-   Enhance CSS styles
-   Insert JS code
