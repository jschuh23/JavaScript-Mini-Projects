# JavaScript-Mini-Projects

This repository contains mini JavaScript projects that I learned while taking two different Udemy courses:
- [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)  
- [The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)  

The course projects consisted of basic HTML code, along with the JavaScript code.  
I plan to expand on this by:  
- Enhancing the HTML code
- Inserting CSS styles
- Adding custom features  

Please read each projects `README.md` file, located in the individual project folders, to learn what I adjusted.
