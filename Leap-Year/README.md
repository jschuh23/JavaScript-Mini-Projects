This course project was a challenge to determine which years are considered Leap Years. The project was an online exercise within the course with no written HTML or CSS.

### My Adjustments

1. I created a HTML file
2. I created a CSS file
3. I created a JS file

### Upcoming Changes

-   Enhance HTML file
-   Insert CSS styles
-   Adjust JS file to make the visitor request internal within the page and not as a prompt
