This course project was a challenge to determine which years are considered Leap Years. The project was an online exercise within the course with no written HTML or CSS.

### My Adjustments

1. Created desktop and mobile designs in figma
1. Wrote HTML code
1. Wrote CSS styles
1. Wrote JS code

### Upcoming Changes

-   Enhance HTML file
-   Insert CSS styles
-   Adjust JS file to make the visitor request internal within the page and not as a prompt
