This course project was a basic BMI calculator with only three BMI guidelines. The project was an online exercise within the course with no written HTML or CSS.

### My Adjustments

1. I did some research online to determine the values for each BMI guideline. This resulted in the addition of the obese category.
2. I created a HTML file
3. I created a CSS file
4. I created a JS file

### Upcoming Changes

-   Enhance HTML file
-   Insert CSS styles
-   Adjust JS file to make the visitor requests internal within the page and not as prompts
