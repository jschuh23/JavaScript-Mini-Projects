This course project was a lesson based on creating a simple todo list. The project was a code-along exercise within the course with no written HTML or CSS.

### My Adjustments

1. I created a HTML file
2. I created a CSS file
3. I created a JS file

### Upcoming Changes

-   Enhance HTML file
-   Insert CSS styles
-   Adjust JS file to make the visitor requests internal within the page and not as prompts
-   Adjust JS file so remarks send to the page and not console log
